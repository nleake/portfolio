      <h1>USA TODAY</h1>
      <p class="date">2013 - 2015</p>
      <p class="intro">Gannett owned over one hundred newspapers and television stations, each with their own websites. The company supported several case management systems (CMS), some of which lacked basic digital publishing features. USA Today is Gannett's largest property, but their error-prone system was notorious in the newsroom for causing delays.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <h3>Goal</h3>
         <p>Create a single CMS for Gannett news sites.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Challenge</h3>
         <p>How might we build an intuitive system that could be used by all Gannett properties?</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>The Team</h3>
         <p>We were eight developers, two product managers, and one designer.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Approach</h3>
         <p>Interview journalists to learn how they work and usability test interactive prototypes.
</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>My Role</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>Design and prioritize features</li>
           <li>Write user stories</li>
           <li>Facilitate interviews and usability tests</li>
           <li>Perform acceptance testing on delivered stories</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>We observed and interviewed dozens of journalists around the country to design a story editor with an inviting interface and intuitive formatting options that would allow journalists to publish breaking news more quickly.</p>
      <h2>Adding Photos</h2>
      <p>Our team designed a simple image upload service that could tag and process large collections of images. We used an assumptions tracker to usability test how well journalists understood the interface.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>After releasing the CMS to the USA TODAY newsroom, it was adopted by Gannett properties nationwide. This later helped enable content sharing across the largest local news network in the United States.
