      <h1>USA TODAY</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2013 - 2015</em></p>
      <p class="intro">Gannett owns over one hundred newspapers and television stations, each with their own websites. The company supported several content management systems (CMS), some of which lacked basic digital publishing features. USA Today is Gannett's largest property, but their error-prone system was notorious in the newsroom for causing issues.</p>
     <ul class="project-details">
       <li>
         <h3>Goal</h3>
         <p>Create a single CMS for all Gannett news sites.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Challenge</h3>
         <p>How might we reduce the time it takes to publish breaking news across Gannett properties?</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>The Team</h3>
         <p>We were eight developers, two product managers, and one designer.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Approach</h3>
         <p>Interview journalists to learn how they write stories and usability test interactive prototypes.
</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>My Role</h3>
         <ul class="my-role">
           <li>Facilitate user research with newsroom staff.</li>
           <li>Translate prototypes into user stories and prioritize the backlog.</li>
           <li>Facilitate design workshops and team agile ceremonies.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>We observed and interviewed Gannett journalists around the country to design a story editor with an inviting interface and intuitive formatting options that would allow journalists to publish breaking news more quickly. We learned that being able to craft SEO-friendly headlines and publishing stories to multiple site sections were all considered vital features for user adoption .</p>
      <h2>Sharing Photos</h2>
      <p>Our team designed a simple image upload service that could tag and process large collections of images. We used an assumptions tracker to usability test how well journalists understood the interface and validate that the prototypes helped users find, crop, and share images across newsrooms.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>After releasing Presto to the USA TODAY newsroom, we rolled it out to all Gannett properties nationwide. Our product gave each site similar publishing capabilities, and enabled content sharing across the largest local news network in the United States.
