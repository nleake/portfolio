      <h1>USA TODAY</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2013 - 2015</em></p>
      <p class="intro">Gannett owned over one hundred newspapers and television stations, each with their own websites. The company supported several content management systems (CMS), some of which lacked basic digital publishing features. USA Today is Gannett's largest property, but their error-prone system was notorious in the newsroom for causing delays.</p>
     <ul class="project-details">
       <li>
         <h3>Goal</h3>
         <p>Create a single CMS for Gannett news sites.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Challenge</h3>
         <p>How might we build an intuitive system that could be used by newsroom staff at all Gannett properties?</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>The Team</h3>
         <p>We were eight developers, two product managers, and one designer.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Approach</h3>
         <p>Interview journalists to learn how they write stories and usability test interactive prototypes.
</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>My Role</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>Lead team of engineers and designers to produce an enterprise CMS for Gannett journalists.</li>
           <li>Facilitate user research with newsroom staff to identify problems and validate solutions.</li>
           <li>Write user stories and prioritize the backlog of work for the engineering team.</li>
           <li>Facilitate design workshops and agile ceremonies for product teams.</li>
           <li>Manage stakeholder expectations and communicate being delivered with each iteration.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>We observed and interviewed dozens of journalists around the country to design a story editor with an inviting interface and intuitive formatting options that would allow journalists to publish breaking news more quickly.</p>
      <h2>Adding Photos</h2>
      <p>Our team designed a simple image upload service that could tag and process large collections of images. We used an assumptions tracker to usability test how well journalists understood the interface and validate that the prototypes solved the problems associated with finding, cropping, and sharing images across newsrooms.

      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>After releasing the CMS to the USA TODAY newsroom, it was rolled out to all Gannett properties nationwide. Our product gave each site similar publishing capabilities, and helped enable content sharing across the largest local news network in the United States.
