      <h1>USCIS</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2017 - present</em></p>
      <p class="intro">At USCIS, I was hired as a product manager to help modernize refugee case management systems. Our team has participated in hundreds of user interviews and regularly tests interactive prototypes for new features using Sketch and InVision.</p>
      <ul class="project-details">
        <li>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>Create a single CMS for the agency to adjudicate asylum and refugee claims.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>How might we build an intuitive system that would empower officers to process cases more efficiently?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Team</h3>
          <p>We were twelve developers, two product managers, and two designers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>Interview refugee and asylum officers to understand the problems they face. Prioritize problems, validate solutions using iterative prototypes, and implement lean features to deliver value quickly.
 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <ul class="my-role">
            <li>Facilitate user research with refugee and asylum officers.</li>
            <li>Write user stories and prioritize the backlog.</li>
            <li>Facilitate design workshops and agile ceremonies.</li>
            <li>Communicate value being delivered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>USCIS officers typically adjudicate dozens of cases for immigration benefits each week, and the agency faces a growing backlog of cases under rapidly shifting policy constraints. Our team was tasked with improving processes related to processing asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/offline_sketch-1200.jpg" alt="a rough sketch of offline scenarios">
      <p>Our team interviewed adjudicating officers, supervisors, policy makers, and division leadership to understand how they worked and the different challenges our users faced. We synthesized our observations into insights and action items that helped us identify opportunities for our app to add value.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/serviceBP-1200.png" alt="a service blueprint the team created">
      <p>We used a service blueprint to visualize and talk about the numerous steps involved in processing each case. We used this to identify core tasks and organize case information into clearly labeled cards.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/redesigned_uscis_ui-1200.png" alt="updated case editing UI">
      <p>After validating prototypes in inVision, I wrote user stories, prioritized our backlog, and worked with our engineers to keep the team delivering updates at a weekly cadence. <em>#BuildMeasureLearn</em></p>
