      <p class="intro">At USCIS, I was hired as a product manager to help modernize refugee and asylum case management systems. Our team has participated in hundreds of user interviews and tests interactive prototypes using Sketch and InVision each week.</p>

      <p>USCIS officers adjudicate immigration benefits, and the agency faces a growing backlog of cases. Our team focused on improving processes related to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/offline_sketch-1200.jpg" alt="a rough sketch of offline scenarios">
      <p>Our team interviewed staff each week to learn about how they worked and the different challenges facing the agency. We synthesized our observations into insights and action items that helped us identify opportunities for our app to add value.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/serviceBP-1200.png" alt="a service blueprint the team created">
      <p>We used a service blueprint to visualize and talk about the numerous steps involved in processing each case. We used this to identify core tasks and organize case information into clearly labeled cards.</p>

      <p>After validating prototypes for a new feature by testing in inVision, I wrote user stories, prioritized our backlog, and worked with our engineers to keep the team delivering updates at a weekly cadence. #BuildMeasureLearn</p>
