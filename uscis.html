      <h1>USCIS</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2017 - present</em></p>
      <p class="intro">At USCIS, I was hired as a product manager to help modernize refugee and asylum case management systems. Our team has participated in hundreds of user interviews and tests interactive prototypes using Sketch and InVision each week.</p>
      <ul class="project-details">
        <li>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>Create a single CMS for the agency to adjudicate asylum and refugee claims.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>How might we build an intuitive system that would enable officers to process cases more efficiently?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Team</h3>
          <p>We were twelve developers, two product managers, and two designers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>Interview refugee and asylum officers to learn about the problems they face. Prioritize problems, validate solutions using iterative prototypes, and implement lean features to deliver value quickly.
 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Work with engineers and designers to produce case management systems for adjudicating asylum and refugee claims.</li>
            <li>Facilitate user research with refugee and asylum officers to identify problems and test prototype solutions.</li>
            <li>Write user stories and prioritize the backlog.</li>
            <li>Facilitate design workshops and agile ceremonies for product teams.</li>
            <li>Manage stakeholder expectations and communicate value being delivered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>USCIS officers adjudicate immigration benefits, and the agency faces a growing backlog of cases. Our team focused on improving processes related to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/offline_sketch-1200.jpg" alt="a rough sketch of offline scenarios">
      <p>Our team interviewed staff each week to learn about how they worked and the different challenges facing the agency. We synthesized our observations into insights and action items that helped us identify opportunities for our app to add value.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/serviceBP-1200.png" alt="a service blueprint the team created">
      <p>We used a service blueprint to visualize and talk about the numerous steps involved in processing each case. We used this to identify core tasks and organize case information into clearly labeled cards.</p>

      <p>After validating prototypes for a new feature by testing in inVision, I wrote user stories, prioritized our backlog, and worked with our engineers to keep the team delivering updates at a weekly cadence. #BuildMeasureLearn</p>
