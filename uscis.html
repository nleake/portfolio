      <h1>USCIS</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2017 - present</em></p>
      <p class="intro">USCIS hired me as a product manager to build more efficient case management systems. Our project had a deadline to deliver an updated system within a year to avoid maintenance costs.

      <ul class="project-details">
        <li>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>Create modern systems for adjudicating asylum and refugee claims.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>How might we build an intuitive application that helps officers process cases more efficiently?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Team</h3>
          <p>We were twelve developers, two product managers, and two designers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>Interview adjudicating officers to understand the problems they face. Prioritize problems, validate prototype solutions, and implement lean features to quickly deliver value.
 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <ul class="my-role">
            <li>Conduct user research and create prototypes.</li>
            <li>Translate designs into user stories and prioritize product backlog.</li>
            <li>Facilitate design workshops, stakeholder check-ins, and team meetings.</li>
            <li>Measure product performance and communicate value delivered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>A USCIS officer interviews almost a dozen cases each week. USCIS faces pressure from a growing backlog of cases and rapidly shifting policies. Leadership tasked our team with reducing case processing time for asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <p>Officers struggled with the agency's mainframe system, saying it was difficult to use. We leveraged US Web Design System (USWDS) to create an accessible component library of cards, lists, tables and buttons that would make it easier for officers to update case information.</p>

      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/search-result-min.png" alt="a search result card from the Global app">
      <p>Our team interviewed officers, supervisors, policy makers, and division leadership throughout the project to understand how they worked and the challenges they faced. We synthesized our research into insights and action items that we used to build the next set of features.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/serviceBP-1200-min.png" alt="a service blueprint the team created">
      <p>We created a service blueprint to understand how asylum cases are processed. This blueprint helped us identify core tasks and organize case information clearly.</p>
      <p>After testing prototypes with users, I wrote user stories, prioritized our backlog, and worked with engineers to deliver working software each week.</p>
