      <h1>USCIS</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2017 - present</em></p>
      <p class="intro">USCIS hired me as a product manager to modernize their refugee case management systems, increase efficiencies, and reduce maintenance costs. Our team was under deadline to deliver an updated system within a year.</p> 
      <ul class="project-details">
        <li>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>Create a modernized system for adjudicating asylum and refugee claims.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>How might we build an intuitive application that helps officers process cases more efficiently?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>The Team</h3>
          <p>We were twelve developers, two product managers, and two designers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Approach</h3>
          <p>Interview adjudicating officers to understand the problems they face. Prioritize problems, validate prototype solutions, and implement lean features to deliver value quickly.
 </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>My Role</h3>
          <ul class="my-role">
            <li>Facilitate user research and help create prototypes.</li>
            <li>Translate designs into user stories and prioritize our backlog.</li>
            <li>Facilitate workshops, stakeholder check-ins, and agile ceremonies.</li>
            <li>Measure and communicate value our team delivered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>A USCIS officer can interview nearly a dozen cases each week, and the agency faces pressure from a growing backlog of cases under rapidly shifting policy constraints. Leadership tasked our team with improving processes related interviewing and deciding cases pertaining to asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
      <p>Users struggled with the agency's mainframe system, citing that it was difficult to learn and made maintaining case loads difficult. Our team used the US Web Design System (USWDS) as a base to create an accessible component library of cards, lists, tables and buttons that would make it easier for officers to view, process, and update case information.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/offline_sketch-1200.jpg" alt="a rough sketch of offline scenarios">
      <p>Our team interviewed adjudicating officers, supervisors, policy makers, and division leadership throughout the project to understand how they worked and the challenges they faced. We synthesized our observations into insights and action items that we used to build the next set of features for our application.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/serviceBP-1200.png" alt="a service blueprint the team created">
      <p>We created a service blueprint to understand the complexities involved in processing each case. The blueprint helped us identify core tasks and organize case information into clearly labeled cards.</p>
      <img class="project__image" src="images/projects/uscis/redesigned_uscis_ui-1200.png" alt="updated case editing UI">
      <p>After testing prototypes with users, I wrote user stories, prioritized our backlog, and worked with our engineers to deliver software each week.</p>
