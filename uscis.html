    Modernize CIS Case Management

USCIS adminsters naturalization and immigration benefits, including refugee and asylum claims. The agency managed a steady backlog of asylum cases using mainfram systems that were increasingly difficult to learn and expensive to maintain.

GOAL
Deliver a modern case management applicaiton and replace the old system within a year.

CHALLENGE
Asylum offices face a growing backlog of cases. How might our app process cases more efficiently?

APPROACH
Interview users to learn about processes and issues. Test iterative Sketch prototypes in inVision.

MY ROLE
Design and prioritize features, write user stories.
Facilitate interviews and usability tests.
Perform acceptance testing on delivered stories.

<h2>User Research</h2>
<p>Our team interviewed office staff each week to learn about their workflows and how they used the system.</p>

We synthesized interview notes to help identify issues and opportunities for efficiency gains within our app. We translated these into clickable prototypes for usability testing.

We built a service blueprint to visualize the case process. We used this to identify core tasks and organize case information into clearly labeled card forms.

<h2>Automatic Transmission</h2>
To send cases to agency partners for processing, users manually keyed information into separate systems. This process tok between ten minutes to an hour per person on each case, and needed to be repeated whenever new information about a person was discovered.

We hypothesized that automating this data transfer from our system would save significant time. These integrations reduced teime spent on this step by 50% to 99%.

<h2>Redesigned UI</h2>

<h2>Managing Scope</h2>
Given that the goal of the project was to retire the legacy system, we prioritized features that would achieve feature parity with the mainframe and add efficiency where possible. This meant that some ideas, such as offline capability, would have to be shelved until later.

<h2>Case Log</h2>
<p>We learned from interviews that cases are reviewed by multiple people, so users needed to see when data had been overwrittern or corrected. We added a case log tab to display a history of changes and updates to the case as we were adding validations for the different form fields.</p>

<h2>Recent Cases</h2>
<p>Users typically worked multiple cases at a time, revisiting them until complete. Displaying recently viewed cases on the home page saved users time finding their work. This was a nice to have feature that wound up saving users from having to search for a specific case number each time.</p>

OUTCOME
<p>Our team delivered the application on time and were able to save the agency from getting billed again for mainframe maintenance. Efficiency gains from data entry and transferring data to processing partners are projected to save millions of dollars per year.</p>
