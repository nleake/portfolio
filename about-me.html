      <p>He is currently a senior product manager at USCIS, where he leads a team of engineers and designers to manage refugee case management systems. He is responsible for all phases of the UX process, from interviewing users and identifying problems to producing mockups and testing interactive prototypes.

      <p>While at USCIS, Nick has helped create asylum and refugee case management systems that help the agency process cases from application to completion, and has introduced features that have boosted efficiency in case processing and reduced manual data entry. The asylum case management system his team produced won the 2018 Directorâ€™s Award and is projected to save the agency millions of dollars in time saved.</p>
      <p>Nick received his BS in Digital Media and Communications from James Madison University in 2011. His foundation in film and journalism informs his work as a UX designer. After working an initial job managing websites for a local newspaper group in central Virginia, Nick landed his first product management position with Gannett, Inc to build a content management system for the USA TODAY Network. This content management system reduced time to publish across Gannett properties, and is detailed in a Poynter case study linked <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/">here.</a></p>
      <p>Nick believes in empowering people with easy to use technology when they need it, and reducing distractions so that they can focus more on what matters. When he is not working, he enjoys spending time outside with his dog, Chloe, practicing meditation or pilates, and working on his illustration skills.</p>
