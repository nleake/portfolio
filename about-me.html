      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="intro">Nick Leake is a UX / UI designer based in Washington, DC. His work combines a background in product management, technology, and user-centered design thinking.</p>
      <p>He is currently a senior designer at 10Pearls, where he helps product teams design meaningful software solutions. He is responsible for all phases of the UX/UI process, from interviewing users and identifying problems to producing mockups and testing interactive prototypes. Nick collaborates with engineers and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to deliver accessible, high quality interfaces. </p>

      <p>Prior to 10Pearls, Nick helped create the Global asylum and refugee case management systems at USCIS. These apps introduced features that boosted efficiency in case processing and reduced manual data entry. Global won the 2018 Directorâ€™s Award and is projected to save the agency millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/zfcSZaoCizs"><strong>Learn more about the Global team.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Nick received his BS in Digital Media and Communications from James Madison University in 2011. His foundation in film and journalism informs his work as a UX designer. After managing websites for a local newspaper group in central Virginia, Nick landed his first product management position with Gannett, Inc where he helped build a content management system for the USA TODAY Network. This system reduced time to publish across Gannett properties, and is detailed in <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/"><strong>this Poynter case study.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Nick believes in empowering people with easy to use technology when they need it, and reducing distractions so that they can focus more on what matters. When he is not working, he enjoys spending time outside with his dog, Chloe, practicing meditation or pilates, and working on his illustration skills.</p>
