      <p>While at USCIS, Nick helped create the Global asylum and refugee case management systems. These apps introduced features that boosted efficiency in case processing and reduced manual data entry. Global won the 2018 Directorâ€™s Award and is projected to save the agency millions of dollars. You can learn more about the Global team <a href="https://youtu.be/zfcSZaoCizs"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Nick received his BS in Digital Media and Communications from James Madison University in 2011. His foundation in film and journalism informs his work as a UX designer. After managing websites for a local newspaper group in central Virginia, Nick landed his first product management position with Gannett, Inc where he helped build a content management system for the USA TODAY Network. This system reduced time to publish across Gannett properties, and is detailed in a Poynter case study linked <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2014/case-study-gannetts-monumental-task-a-content-management-system-for-all/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Nick believes in empowering people with easy to use technology when they need it, and reducing distractions so that they can focus more on what matters. When he is not working, he enjoys spending time outside with his dog, Chloe, practicing meditation or pilates, and working on his illustration skills.</p>
