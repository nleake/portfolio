Embassy of the Netherlands
The Embassy of Holland was looking to improve the cosmetic appearance of their site. They were seeking to make it user friendly and more appealing to the eye. They were hoping these changes would improve the relations between the two countries as well as foster cultural exchange, business opportunities, and promote Holland’s leading role in the scientific and technology fields.

Each infographic was tailored to Holland’s landmarks, architectural structures, and cities.
