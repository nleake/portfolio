      <h1>Netherlands Embassy</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2015 - 2016</em></p>
      <p class="intro">The Embassy of the Netherlands wanted a redesigned website to grow business with the United States. The embassy had blogs and social media accounts they wanted to increase traffic to, and the legacy site was difficult to navigate.</p>

     <ul class="project-details">
       <li>
         <h3>Goal</h3>
         <p>Redesign website to increase visitor engagement. Empower clients to publish new content regularly.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Challenge</h3>
         <p>How might we highlight innovations from the Netherlands while increasing traffic to blogs and social media accounts?</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>The Team</h3>
         <p>One project manager, two graphic designers, and two developers.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Approach</h3>
         <p>Interview stakeholders to understand the problem. Create moodboards to capture desired look and feel for the new site. Use card sorting and existing content to create sitemaps and Sketch prototypes.
</p>
       </li>
     </ul>
      
      <h2>Project Kickoff</h2>
      <p>We interviewed embassy staff to learn more about their mission and the desired project outcomes.
After researching embassy sites and social media accounts, we workshopped moodboards with the client to find a look that matched their branding guidelines and used card sorting to organize site content.</p>

      <p>Our stakeholders wanted to highlight contributions from the Netherlands in subjects such as agriculture, technology, art, and design. We crafted a new home page that linked to pages highlighting these innovations in more detail, and simplified the site navigation to encourage visitors to read the staffâ€™s posts.</p>

      <h2>Creating Mocks</h2>
      <p>After agreeing on the structure for the home page, sections, and article pages, I created high fidelity prototypes to illustrate what a finished product might look like and wrote user stories for our development team.</p>

      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
      <p>Once we had the main pages built, we trained embassy staff on WordPress so that they could update the site. We also taught them how to use Google Analytics to monitor audience engagement.</p>
