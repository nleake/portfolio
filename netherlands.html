      <h1>Netherlands Embassy</h1>
      <p class="date"><em>2015 - 2016</em></p>
      <p class="intro">The Embassy of the Netherlands wanted a redesigned website to grow business with the United States. The embassy had a blog and social media accounts they wanted to leverage, but the legacy site was difficult to navigate.</p>

         <h3>Goal</h3>
         <p>Redesign website to increase visitor engagement. Empower clients to publish new content regularly.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Challenge</h3>
         <p>How might we highlight innovations from the Netherlands while increasing traffic to blogs and social media accounts?</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>The Team</h3>
         <p>One project manager, two graphic designers, and two developers.</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>Approach</h3>
         <p>Interview stakeholders to scope the project. Create moodboards to capture desired look and feel for the new site. Use card sorting and existing content to create sitemaps and Sketch prototypes.
</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h3>My Role</h3>
         <ul class="my-role">
           <li>Manage scope and facilitate workshops with clients.</li>
           <li>Work with graphic designers to create prototypes and illustrations.</li>
           <li>Use mocks to write user stories and acceptance test delivered features.</li>
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
      
      <h2>Project Kickoff</h2>
      <p>We interviewed embassy staff to learn more about their mission and the desired project outcomes.
After researching embassy sites and social media accounts, we workshopped moodboards with the client to find a look that matched their branding guidelines and used card sorting to organize site content.</p>

      <h2>Creating Mocks</h2>
      <p>We took categories from our card sort to build a sitemap and Balsamiq mockups to illustrate a simpler site navigation. This sectioned the site based on types of innovation from the Netherlands.
</p>
      <p>After agreeing on the structure for the home page, sections, and article pages, I created high fidelity prototypes in Sketch to illustrate what a finished product might look like.</p>

      <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
      <p>Once we had the main pages built and analytics in place, we trained embassy staff to manage site content and monitor performance.</p>
