    Netherlands Embassy Redesign
The Embassy of the Netherlands wanted a redesigned website to help advertise the country and grow business with the United States. The embassy had a blog and social media accounts they wanted to leverage, but the legacy site was difficult to navigate.

GOAL
Redesign website to increase visitor engagement. Empower clients to publish new site content regularly.

CHALLENGE
How might we highlight innovations from the Netherlands while increasing traffic to blog articles and social media accounts?

THE TEAM
One project manager, two graphic designers, and two developers.

APPROACH
Interview stakeholders to scope the project. Create moodboards to capture desired look and feel for the new site. Use card sorting and existing content to create sitemaps and Sketch prototypes.

MY ROLE
Manage scope and facilitate workshops with clients.
Work with graphic designers to create prototypes and illustrations.
Use mocks to write user stories and acceptance test delivered features.

<h2>Project Kickoff</h2>
We interviewed stakeholders to learn more about their mission and the desired project outcomes.
After researching embassy sites and social media accounts, we workshopped moodboards with the client to find a look that matched their branding guidelines and used card sorting to organize and categorize content.

<h2>Creating Mockups</h2>
We took the categories from our card sort to build a sitemap and Balsamiq mockups to illustrate a simpler site navigation. This sectioned the site based on types of innovation from the Netherlands.
After agreeing on the structure for the home page, sections, and article pages, I created high fidelity prototypes in Sketch to illustrate what a finished product might look like.
<aside>On the article pages, we added links to related stories to promote exploration, as well as continuous scrolling. Visitors could share articles on social media and view links to other Netherlands embassy sites in the footer.
TODO Add more details about lessons learned during this project..

<h2>Building to MVP</h2>
I used Sketch prototypes to write and review user stories with our remote engineers. Once we had a basic WordPress instance and analytics in place, I trained embassy saff on hwo to update content and monitor performance. We prioritized completing the main pages so that we could launch as soon as possible.


OUTCOME
We delivered a site that the embassy was proud of within eleven weeks. We enabled their staff to more easily monitor performance, make updates, and add new content.
